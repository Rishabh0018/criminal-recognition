#Criminal recogniser
Hello judges I am Rishabh Kamthare a mentee in engange 2022. 
I am writing this here as due to some issues in my microphone at the very end momentand due to that I was unable to record the audio in the demo video.

I had my Mid-sem tests, end semester examinations and viva examinations all over this period of the mentorship programme, that's why I was not able to build something which shows my full potential. Other than that I mailed the mentor assigned to me several times but of no avail, so I had to do it all by myself.

This project just detects the faces which are uploaded in the labeled_images folder inside the public folder and then logs the data.

This project can be extended for loging the criminal's name and sending a notification to police department and concerned authorites as soon as he/she comes into the aperture of the camera installed at squares.

I know this project is a basic one but it can be extended for many purposes other than the one described above.

I am very thankful of microsoft for providing me the amazing opportunity.
