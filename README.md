<h1>#Criminal recogniser</h1> <br>
<h2>
Hello judges I am Rishabh Kamthare a mentee in engange 2022. 
I am writing this here as due to some issues in my microphone at the very end moment, I was unable to record the audio in the demo video.
</h2>

I had my Mid-sem tests, end semester examinations and viva examinations all over this period of the mentorship programme, that's why I was not able to build something which shows my full potential. Other than that I mailed the mentor assigned to me several times but of no avail, so I had to do it all by myself.

This project just detects the faces which are uploaded in the labeled_images folder inside the public folder and then logs the data.

This project can be extended for loging the criminal's name and sending a notification to police department and concerned authorites as soon as he/she comes into the aperture of the camera installed at squares.

I know this project is a basic one but it can be extended for many purposes other than the one described above.

I am very thankful of microsoft for providing me the amazing opportunity.

The technical description and how it must be tested is as follows

<b>Some of the Major technologies used:</b>
1. <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a>
2. <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">ExpressJS</a>
3. <a href="https://javascript.info/" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>

Prerequisites to run the app in local environment
1. Installed NodeJS


<b>Step 1:</b>
In the cloned repository run command <h4> npm install</h4>
<br>
<b>Step 2:</b>
Now, run command <h4> npm start</h4>
<b>Congratulations!</b>
You can now visit localhost:3000 and allow the camera access to the browser. Alternatively if the code is opened in vs code then just open index.html from public folder and run the extension live server <h4>Preferable browser is Google chrome</h4>
<br>
<h6>As it is a browser based application it may take a few seconds to ask for the camera access or loading the models So kindly wait for a few seconds</h6>
You are good to GO now. you can check the image data and detected data in console.
